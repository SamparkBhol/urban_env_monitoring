# Urban Environment Monitoring

## Objective

Hi there! Welcome to my project on urban environment monitoring. The goal here is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to segment satellite images and monitor urban growth and environmental changes over time. This project will analyze temporal satellite data to detect changes in land cover, urban infrastructure development, deforestation, and the impacts of natural disasters.

## Project Structure

Here's how I've organized the project:

- **data/**
  - **raw/**: Contains the raw data files.
  - **processed/**: Stores the processed data ready for model training.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
  - **data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Notebook for preprocessing the data.
  - **model_training.ipynb**: Notebook for training the CNN.
  - **evaluation.ipynb**: Notebook for evaluating the model.
- **src/**: Source code for various functionalities.
  - **data_loader.py**: Code for loading and processing the dataset.
  - **model.py**: The CNN model architecture.
  - **train.py**: Script for training the model.
  - **evaluate.py**: Script for evaluating the model.
- **scripts/**: Shell scripts for running different stages of the project.
  - **preprocess_data.sh**: Script to preprocess the data.
  - **train_model.sh**: Script to train the model.
  - **evaluate_model.sh**: Script to evaluate the model.
- **results/**
  - **segmentation_maps/**: Contains the segmentation maps generated by the model.
  - **change_detection_maps/**: Contains maps showing changes detected over time.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
First, I'll collect the necessary datasets from Kaggle. Once I have the data, I'll preprocess it by:
- Rescaling images to a standard size.
- Normalizing pixel values.
- Labeling and organizing temporal data.

### 2. Model Architecture
I'll design a CNN for image segmentation. A good starting point is the U-Net architecture, which is highly effective for segmentation tasks. Additionally, I'll incorporate temporal data using 3D CNNs or LSTM layers to capture changes over time.

### 3. Training the Model
I'll split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and then train the model using the training set. Throughout the training process, I'll evaluate the model on the validation set and fine-tune the hyperparameters.

### 4. Post-Processing
Once the model is trained, I'll use it to segment images and classify different land cover types. I'll also analyze changes between different time periods to detect urban growth, deforestation, and other changes.

### 5. Visualization and Analysis
Using tools like matplotlib, I'll visualize the segmentation results and create change maps to highlight significant changes over time. This analysis will help draw insights about urban growth and environmental changes.

### 6. Deployment
Finally, I'll document the project thoroughly and provide a detailed README file with instructions on how to use the model. I'll upload the project to GitHub with the complete codebase and pretrained models. Additionally, I'll create an interactive demo using tools like Streamlit or Flask to allow users to test the model with their own data.
